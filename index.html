          Being the security officer of your Hack Club isn't always the most
          exciting job but today is different. You wake up and the first thing
          you see is your Slack notifications going crazy. Apparently there has
          been a heist and everyone's
          <span class="username">@banker</span> accounts are emptied out.</p>
          <p>You look at <span class="username">@banker</span>'s transaction logs and
          see that all the money has been transferred to
          <span class="username">@aeon</span> and
          <span class="username">@zeno</span>'s accounts. You decide to look
          through the Slack logs and see that they used a private messaging
          website to plan the heist. Upon visiting the link, you realize you
          have access to their private chatroom since the website is poorly
          secured. You start going through the messages and evidently they
          planned this as a challenge for you. You briefly get
          a glimpse of the code you need to bring everything back to normal but
          it vanishes before your eyes.
