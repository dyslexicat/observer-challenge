# observer-challenge

## description

This is a challenge I have made where you can learn about how to use the [Mutation Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver). As the narrator says on the challenge, please let me know (@alp) if you have any suggestions on how to make the challenge better or if you ever use the API on your own projects.

Here is a real-life example of the API being useful to observe Twitch chat messages: [twitch-chat-tracker](https://github.com/dyslexicat/twitch-chat-tracker).

You can message me if you need confirmation about the flag or hints.

I have removed the actual flag from the code but otherwise it is the unobfuscated code on the challenge website. Feel free to clone it and make changes to the styling or the behaviour.

It was made purely by HTML, CSS and Javascript.
